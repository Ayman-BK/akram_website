        <div class="about">One day we were children and we still are. We were children, making shapes out of clay, laughing, getting hungry and going, sometimes stealing bunches of grapes, our neighbor would get angry and shout at us so we would run away. We would go to school in village clothes, decorated with dirt and mud. The bell would ring and we would bite our long nails for fear of the principal. Then a teacher (Faleh) would come and teach us how to dream when we grow up, to make our orphan village of trees, colorful with fig and quince trees. We would build our houses out of red bricks. We dreamed that Iraq would become more beautiful, that America would fall and that Iraq would become greater. We were children who did not know how to explain what we dreamed of when we grew up?! Our childhood was a dream that passed through the wheat fields, behind our villages everything turned to stone. We grew up and our pens grew, but our dream did not grow. It was confined to the corner of war, and our villages were emptied of people, and we are homeless on these weeping sidewalks, selling our pens. Who will buy my pens even for a piece of bread? My little sister is hungry in this camp. I grew up, and this child inside me did not grow up, America did not fall, and I did not learn how to interpret my dream, this child inside me died while chanting these words: No, you did not lose anything except your soul How will you gather your strength, my son? You are nothing but a small seagull From the remnants of this war With wounded wings You fell into the sea, the calm, deceptive sea Your cheerful friends How many of them drowned How many of them are the remains of their bones on the shore You, Arabs, this is how you bury human bodies In cold blood Seagulls destroyed by travel Wondering in the nests of exile Where is Akram? And some speak Who is Akram?! Akram was drowned by the waves of the sea It threw him up brutally It killed him brutally How many children among us die And humanity dies with them The scales of justice are blind They say let that Yazidi minority end If we are not human beings, then who are we? Are we not from Adam or has Eve not conceived us yet? How many a generous person was drowned by the sea and how many a generous person are the remains of his bones in Shingal, thrown on the sidewalks and among the stones.... We were children dreaming that Iraq would become more beautiful, that America would fall and that Iraq would become greater. We grew up but this dream did not grow up. We grew up but this child did not grow up and the dream remained a dream.
